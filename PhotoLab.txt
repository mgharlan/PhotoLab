This assignment was time consuming more than anything. Changing the implementation from 
arrays to dynamic structures and arrays was difficult and took a lot of time. 
It was hard to break everything up into testable pieces. The saturate and rotate
functions were easy to implement and the enlarge part of the resize function
went smoothly. I was unable to finish the resize small. I left the part that 
was close commented out. I was able to get the image to change size but for 
some reason it comes out very yellow when I try to average the values. I learned
a lot in this assignment and I feel confident in my ability to design and use malloc
and free. I am disappointed that I was unable to implement all parts of the function.
